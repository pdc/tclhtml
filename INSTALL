			INSTALLING TCLHTML 5.1


Revision 5.1.3 (P. Damian Cugley, 1999-04-25), for TclHTML version 5.1. 

TclHTML is a simple generator for HTML files, designed for people who
like Tcl. It comprises a new command thc which converts .th files
(written in Tcl) into HTML files.

The implementation is 100% pure Tcl, so no compilation as such is
required. There is a configure script and Makefile which takes care of
generating the documentation, and copying its scripts and library
files in to the installation directories.


CONFIGURATION

The configure script is not generated with autoconf; instead it is
written in Tcl. You should be able to run it with the command

     ./configure ?option...?

but if that does not work, invoke the Tcl shell explicity:

     tclsh ./configure ?option...?

Since this package is 100% Tcl, there is actually very little
configuration to do. The script writes a config.status script, and
then generates a makefile from the template Makefile.in. These options
can be used to control configuration process:

     --prefix=dir 
     -p dir 
          Set the common prefix for the installation directories. 
          Default: /usr/local. 

     --datadir=dir 
     -dd dir 
          Set the directory in which the Tcl definition files for
          TclHTML will be installed. Usually you will want a
          subdirectory with a package-specific name like tclhtml-5.1,
          within /usr/local/lib or similar.  
	  Default: $prefix/lib/tclhtml-5.1

     --scriptdir=dir 
     -sd dir 
          Set the directory where executable files that are not
          machine-specific go -- such as Tcl scripts.
          Default: $prefix/bin 

     --htmldir=dir 
     -hd dir 
          A directory in which to place HTML documentation for this package. 
          Default: $prefix/doc/tclhtml-5.1 

     --mandir=dir 
     -md dir 
          A directory in which to place manual pages for this package. 
          Default: $prefix/man 

     --install=cmd 
     -i cmd 
          A generic command to use to install a file in a directory. 
          Default: install -c 

     --install_script=cmd 
     -is cmd 
          A command to use to install an executable script file in a
          directory.
          Default: $INSTALL -m 755 

     --install_data=cmd 
     -id cmd 
          A command to use to install an non-executable data file in a
          directory.
          Default: $INSTALL -m 644 

     --nocreate 
     -n 
          Do the configuration and create config.status, but do not
          generate the makefile.

     --help 
     -h 
     -? 
          Print a short help message, and don't do configuration. 

     --version 
     -V 
          Print the version number of the configure script, and don't
          do configuration.


RUNNING MAKE

The makefile implements several of the usual pseudo-targets, like all,
clean, and install.

make all 
     regenerates the HTML documentation for TclHTML. With GNU make,
     this also checks if the configuration status file has been
     changed and regenerates the makefile and so on.

make install 
     Copies the scripts and library files in to the appropriate
     directories. You will need superuser priviledges if these are in
     system directories like /usr/local.

make uninstall 
     Deletes the files created with make install.
