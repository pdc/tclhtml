TclHTML -- Generate HTML files using Tcl scripts

DESCRTIPTION

    This is a package for generating collections of HTML pages using
    scripts written in the Tool Command Language (Tcl).  It includes:

	`thc', a command for compiling TclHTML scripts (`.th' files),

	`notables', a script for stripping tables and other non-text tags from
	    HTML files, and 

	`thmkmf', a Makefile generator for directory trees of `.th' files.

    I've included manual pages for these commands.  The rest of the
    documentation is in HTML format, on the assumption that if you are
    interested in an HTML generator you have access to an HTML
    reader...


INSTALLATION

    This is a pure Tcl package; no compilation is required.  For
    consistency's sake I have nevertheless supplied a GNU-style
    `configure' script which generates a makefile that handles
    installation.  The `configure' script uses Tcl rather than `sh',
    on the assumption that if you're installing a Tcl package, you
    will have Tcl already installed.

    For more information on installation, see `install.html'.
